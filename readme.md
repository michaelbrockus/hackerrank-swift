# HackerRank Swift project

## About

* * *

The `HackerRank` project is a list of solutions for problems found on the
`HackerRank` website written in `Swift`. It would be important to mention that
each solution is stored in its own git branch, so the best way to view the
written solutions for their corresponding problem can be done by switching
git branches.

## Contact the developer

You may find that I have a number of ways that you can contact
me. All of these methods happen to be listed on my blogging platform
[Mike's virtual office](https://michaelbrockus.home.blog/contact/).

Lastly don't forget to have a cup of virtual coffee. Thanks.
